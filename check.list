### Checklist to validate all necessary files/folders for application

### "#" is ignored for Comments


##### RULES FOR SYNTAX CHECKLIST ENTRIES #####

### Each item/token will be referred as a Token

### All tokens must be delimited/split by a space (e.g. item1 "item2" item3 item_name)


### Token syntax is: 1st token is verify, 2nd-4th tokens is one set of actions to run once,
#                    5th-7th tokens is optional second set of actions to run after the first set.

# 1st token is the Reference Token, which is the target file/folder to verify

# 2nd, 3rd, and 4th tokens are Action Tokens
#   - 2nd token can call/launch a file, or call a function from the main script
#   - 3rd & 4th tokens are optional arguments that can be passed into the call/launch of the 2nd token

# 5th token can call/launch a file, or call a function from the main script if needing to run a second action
# 6th, and 7th tokens are optional tokens to be passed into the 5th token, or may be used in the following:
#   - EXAMPLE: !putty_install! :install_program !putty_dep! "BLANK" !send_error! 103 Checklist-SECTION:Installation_Check
#   - EXPLAIN: 1st token will check if PuTTY is installed, if not, then run the install function (2nd token) from the 
#              main script and passin the PuTTY file installer location argument (3rd token) to run it. The "BLANK"
#              is a arbitrary string and isn't used at all, but is needed to get to the second set of actions (5th-7th tokens).
#              5th token is calling the error engine, and the 6th & 7th tokens are passing in the error code number and error
#              comment into the error engine to report an error if PuTTY did not succesfully install after the 1st set of actions
#   - SUMMARY: If program is not installed, it will run the first set of actions (2nd-4th tokens), after first set of actions
#              has run, then run second set of actions (5th-7th tokens).
